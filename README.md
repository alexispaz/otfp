# On the fly parameterization 

OTFP computes free-energy surfaces (FES) in MD simulations via temperature-acceleration. 
 
It is written in C and use [SWIG](http://www.swig.org) to provida a TCL
interface to be used with [NAMD](www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd) via TCLforce.
 
## Build system

There is a `src/makefile` file that can be used to build libraries and
executables. It is also posible to compile using meson, e.g.:

    git clone https://github.com/alexispaz/otfp.git
    cd otfp
    meson setup build 
    cd build
    meson compile -v

Then, to install `meson install` or to create a distribution `meson dist`.
Default prefix is `/usr` but can be changed with `--prefix`, for instance:

    meson setup --prefix=$(realpath ./usr) build

In summary, here a single line example to configure, compile, and install:

    rm -fr build/; meson setup --prefix=$(realpath ./usr) build; cd build; meson compile -v; meson install; cd ..

To improve eficiency in solving periodicity in FES, Direct Sparse Solvers of Intel Math Kernel Library can be use. Intel
oneAPI MKL (oneMKL) provides pkg-config metadata files that can be used by
meson build system. Check them with:

    pkg-config --list-all | grep mkl

The setup will be something like

    meson setup --prefix=$(realpath ./usr) -Dblas=mkl-dynamic-lp64-gomp -Dlapack=mkl-dynamic-lp64-gomp build 

To run the examples, set the `CFACV_BASEDIR` environment variable to the OTFP
prefix:

    cd examples/OTFP/
    export CFACV_BASEDIR=../../usr
    ./test.sh

## Known issues

In [SWIG documentation](http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Tcl.html) it is written: 

> "As a final complication, a major weakness of C++ is that it does not define any
> sort of standard for binary linking of libraries. This means that C++ code
> compiled by different compilers will not link together properly as libraries
> nor is the memory layout of classes and data structures implemented in any kind
> of portable manner. In a monolithic C++ program, this problem may be unnoticed.
> However, in Tcl, it is possible for different extension modules to be compiled
> with different C++ compilers. As long as these modules are self-contained, this
> probably won't matter. However, if these modules start sharing data, you will
> need to take steps to avoid segmentation faults and other erratic program
> behavior. If working with lots of software components, you might want to
> investigate using a more formal standard such as COM."

Thus, it is recommended to compile OTFP using the same compiler used to compile
NAMD. 

Another problem that can arise is a segmentation fault when the TCL script of
NAMD input loads the compiled `cfacv.so` shared library. This might be related with
differences in the linking of the tcl library in NAMD and in the `cfacv.so`
library. To find which tcl library is using NAMD execute `ldd ./namd2`.  Use
that library to compile `cfacv.so`.

If the tcl library is not found by ldd, it is probably linked static. In that
case `nm ./namd2 | grep Tcl` will show the common symbols defined in the tcl
library (e.g. `Tcl_AppendResult`). This make difficult to known which tcl
version was used to compile NAMD. If using the tcl library of the actual system
gives segmentation fault, sometimes the issue disappears if the user compile
its own TCL library from source and use that one to compile of `cfacv.so`.

## Examples of additional tools to handle chapeau object files

Convert old format of chapeau object files, create `converted.ch`

    ./chapconv run12.ch0 

Cropping or expanding the CV space, create `croped.ch`

    ./chapcrop cryo.ch 4 18.40076 4 18.40076

Attempt to add chapeau object files

    ./chapadd croped_*ch

If attempt fail, it might be needed to adjust the size of chapeau objects to
have the same number of knots using `chapcrop`
