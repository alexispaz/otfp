# Particle Mesh Ewald algorithm
PME                 on
# The particle mesh is a 3-D grid created in the
# system over which the system charge is distributed. From this charge,
# potentials and forces on atoms in the system are determined. As a result,
# your grid size should be chosen such that it is fine enough to accurately
# represent the configuration of your system.
PMEgridspacing      1 
# Sets the minimum ratio between the number of PME grid points along each
# cellBasisVector and the physical dimensions. Since the grid will replicate
# the charge distribution in your system, PMEGridSpacing should be chosen to
# be large enough so that the grid spacing accurately reproduces your charge
# distribution. However, it should not be so large that it will slow down your
# simulation to provide unnecessary precision.  Typically, a grid density of
# slightly more than 1/A is a good choice to reproduce charge distribution in
# biological systems, where the closest atoms have a bond separation on the
# order of 1 A. This corresponds to a PMEGridSpacing of 1.0. NAMD will then
# automatically set the PME grid sizes (see below) such that there is always
# less than 1.0A between grid points and the sizes contain only small prime
# factors (e.g. 2, 3, and 5).

# # Constant Pressure Control (variable volume)

# # NAMD calculates system pressure based on the forces between atoms and their
